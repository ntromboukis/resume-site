Fill in the appropriate sections in the code with your experience to have a beautiful resume site.

Usage
In the index.html file you want to change line 12 to include a title of your own.

```<title>FILL IN WITH YOUR TITLE</title>```

Navigate to the js folder and now you want to edit the resumebuilder.js and helper.js files. I have included instructions in the comments.
For example, in resumebuilder.js:
```Javascript
var bio = {
    "name": "INSERT YOUR NAME",
    "role": "INSERT YOUR ROLE",
    ...
    ...
```

This was project 2 from the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.
Enjoy!
